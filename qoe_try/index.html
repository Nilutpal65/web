In the placement process, special importance is given to mathematical puzzles. The interviewer may treat a correct answer to a puzzle as incomplete if the student hits it accidentally or the student is not able to explain the logic behind it. So, the main idea behind asking a puzzle is to see one's analytical skills as to how one approaches a question in case (a) even if one knows the answer (b) or, one doesn’t know the answer to the puzzle being thrown. So, we take them through the interviewers' perspective of the interview.

Our suggestion to students remains that one must not go for cramming or practicing more and more puzzles but to practice a limited set of good quality puzzles and understanding the crux of the puzzle and finding multiple alternatives for solving it. This helps in developing the thought process and helps find a pattern in similar as well as different kinds of puzzles. One must also try to find a mathematical justification/ logic behind every step in the puzzle. This part has a major contribution in the total score given to the question.

The C, C++ questions in the interviews are less on book-ish knowledge and more on the practical experience esp. in accordance with the industry practices for ex. using Design Patterns.

Tips for Resume Building -We should always remember that one’s resume is the first thing that any recruiter/Interviewer sees before short listing/interviewing the candidate. So, one needs to learn the technique of presenting all of one’s U.S.P.s on a single sheet of paper.

The correct approach to studying Algorithms is to link the algorithm questions with puzzles and break them into smaller problems. There is also a special significance of generating suitable scenarios/test cases of the problem. Also, one needs to work forward and backward on the following identity - Data Structure + Puzzle = Algorithm. One should be able to segregate a puzzle and data structure from an algorithm and vice-versa.

Hence, the idea is not to practice more and more questions, but to correct our approach while dealing with the same set of questions.

The sooner we embed these ideas into daily practice, the more we would prepare ourselves for any test - be it a competitive exam, placement written/interviews, higher studies or daily job work.
